    <h3>About The Golden Crumb:</h3>

    <br>

    <p style="font-size: 115%">The Golden Crumb began in a tiny kitchen that always smelled like butter and vanilla. What started as a weekend hobby, experimenting with cookie dough and chasing the perfect loaf of bread, slowly turned into a passion for creating and sharing recipes that anyone could bake at home.
        During 2020, when the world slowed down, baking became more than just mixing ingredients. It became comfort, creativity, and connection. That’s when The Golden Crumb was born: a small online space to share tried-and-true recipes with a sprinkle of storytelling.
        Every recipe here is tested, tasted, and made with love (and usually a bit of a mess). From soft breads to golden pastries, our goal is to make baking feel simple, joyful, and rewarding, whether you’re a beginner or a seasoned baker.
        So grab your whisk, preheat the oven, and join us in baking up something golden!</p>
